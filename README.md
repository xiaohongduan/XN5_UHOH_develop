# XN5
To build and install XN5 consider the expertn_doc.pdf-file in the dev-folder (chapter 2 and especially section 2.3). expertn_bin will be installed in built/bin if no other prefix is specified when running ./waf configure.

To use the graphical user interface (gui) you have to create the files expertn_gui.ini and xnoplot.ini first. Templates for those files are in the gui-folder, so you just have to copy and rename the templates. As there are paths specified in the ini-files, we decided to provide these files just as templates.

Don't forget to change the ~/.bashrc-file if you do not want to setup the Expert-N Environment again and again.

In git, there are no real revision numbers, but unique hashtags instead, to which everyone can refer.
